This is the code for our kernel methods project :

To get the classification for the testing set, run Building_submission.py
To get a local result with cross validation run Cross_validation.py

- HOG.py : contains the functions we used to do the pre-processing we did on the pictures
- SVM_algo.py : contains the SVM algorithm we implemented
- accuracy.py : contains the accuracy functions we used locally for the classification
- kernel_functions.py : contains the different kernel expressions we used for the algorithm.
- Cross_validation.py : running this file makes a cross-validation on the training set
- Building_submission.py : predict classes for the testing set of the challenge
